# Safer Safe

Safer Safe is a multisig solution designed to significantly enhance security, minimize reliance on external services, and simplify the verification of recurring transactions. Safer Safe leverages fully on-chain Actions contracts and dynamic timelocks to ensure security, transparency, and resilience.

## Setup

1. Install Foundry by following the instructions from [their repository](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry#installation).
2. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the variables.
3. Install the dependencies by running: `yarn install`. In case there is an error with the commands, run `foundryup` and try them again.

## Build

The default way to build the code is suboptimal but fast, you can run it via:

```bash
yarn build
```

In order to build a more optimized code ([via IR](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.15/ir-breaking-changes.html#solidity-ir-based-codegen-changes)), run:

```bash
yarn build:optimized
```

## Running tests

Unit tests should be isolated from any externalities, while Integration usually run in a fork of the blockchain. In this boilerplate you will find example of both.

In order to run both unit and integration tests, run:

```bash
yarn test
```

In order to just run unit tests, run:

```bash
yarn test:unit
```

In order to run unit tests and run way more fuzzing than usual (5x), run:

```bash
yarn test:unit:deep
```

In order to just run integration tests, run:

```bash
yarn test:integration
```

In order to start the Medusa fuzzing campaign (requires [Medusa](https://github.com/crytic/medusa/blob/master/docs/src/getting_started/installation.md) installed), run:

```bash
yarn test:fuzz
```

In order to just run the symbolic execution tests (requires [Halmos](https://github.com/a16z/halmos/blob/main/README.md#installation) installed), run:

```bash
yarn test:symbolic
```

In order to check your current code coverage, run:

```bash
yarn coverage
```

## Deploy & verify

### Setup

Configure the `.env` variables and source them:

```bash
source .env
```

Import your private keys into Foundry's encrypted keystore:

```bash
cast wallet import $MAINNET_DEPLOYER_NAME --interactive
```

```bash
cast wallet import $SEPOLIA_DEPLOYER_NAME --interactive
```

### Sepolia

```bash
yarn deploy:sepolia
```

### Mainnet

```bash
yarn deploy:mainnet
```

The deployments are stored in ./broadcast

See the [Foundry Book for available options](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/forge-create.html).

## Export And Publish

Export TypeScript interfaces from Solidity contracts and interfaces providing compatibility with TypeChain. Publish the exported packages to NPM.

To enable this feature, make sure you've set the `NPM_TOKEN` on your org's secrets. Then set the job's conditional to `true`:

```yaml
jobs:
  export:
    name: Generate Interfaces And Contracts
    # Remove the following line if you wish to export your Solidity contracts and interfaces and publish them to NPM
    if: true
    ...
```

Also, remember to update the `package_name` param to your package name:

```yaml
- name: Export Solidity - ${{ matrix.export_type }}
  uses: defi-wonderland/solidity-exporter-action@1dbf5371c260add4a354e7a8d3467e5d3b9580b8
  with:
    # Update package_name with your package name
    package_name: "my-cool-project"
    ...


- name: Publish to NPM - ${{ matrix.export_type }}
  # Update `my-cool-project` with your package name
  run: cd export/my-cool-project-${{ matrix.export_type }} && npm publish --access public
  ...
```
